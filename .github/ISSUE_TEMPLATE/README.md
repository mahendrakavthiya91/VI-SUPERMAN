## How the Processor Uses Templates

When you create an issue with these templates, the **AI GitHub Issue Processor** automatically:

1. **Reads the issue title and description**
2. **Detects the issue type:**
   - 🐛 Bug Fix → Searches for existing files and modifies them
   - ✨ New Feature → Creates a new file
   - 🚀 Project Setup → Generates complete project structure
3. **Generates code** using Claude Haiku AI
4. **Creates a branch** with the solution
5. **Opens a PR** with the changes
6. **Adds labels** (code-review, ai-generated, bug-fix, etc.)
7. **Sends email notification** to you

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **Be Specific** - More details = better code generation
✅ **Include Context** - What's the purpose? Why do you need this?
✅ **Use Exact Paths** - If fixing a file, provide the exact file path
✅ **Add Examples** - Show what you want, not just describe it
✅ **One Issue = One Task** - Keep issues focused and specific
